# An Introduction to MakeU

The "MakeU - A Habit Tracking Android Application" is a project aimed at developing a habit tracking application for Android devices. The application is built using the Kotlin programming language, which is a statically-typed language designed to improve developer productivity, reduce code verbosity, and improve code safety. The project also makes use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, which facilitate code reuse and make the application easier to maintain.
Habit tracking is an increasingly popular practice that involves monitoring one's daily habits to create positive behavioural changes. The benefits of tracking one's habits are numerous and include increased productivity, improved health and wellness, and enhanced self-awareness. By tracking their habits, users can identify patterns in their behaviour and make adjustments to improve their overall well-being.
The "MakeU - A Habit Tracking Android Application" aims to provide users with an intuitive and user-friendly habit tracking tool that can be customised to their specific needs. The application allows users to set and track their daily habits. By helping users build and maintain healthy habits, the application can have a significant impact on their overall quality of life.
In this project report, we will discuss the development process of the "MakeU - A Habit Tracking Android Application," including the design and implementation of key features using Kotlin and OOP concepts. We will also highlight the benefits of habit tracking and demonstrate how the application can be used to help users achieve their goals.

Gradle, a powerful build automation tool, was used extensively in the development of the "MakeU - A Habit Tracking Android Application." Gradle is a flexible and configurable system that provides developers with a convenient way to manage dependencies, compile code, run tests, and package and deploy the application. One of the key benefits of using Gradle is its ability to manage complex project structures with ease. The application's build.gradle file was used to specify various dependencies, including the Android SDK and third-party libraries, such as Room Database, which was used to manage the application's data. Additionally, Gradle was used to generate the APK file, which is the final package that can be installed on Android devices. The use of Gradle helped to streamline the development process and ensure that the application was built efficiently and accurately.

Firebase, a mobile and web application development platform, was used in the "MakeU - A Habit Tracking Android Application" for user authentication and database management. Firebase Authentication provides an easy-to-use and secure authentication system that allows users to sign up and log in to the application using their email and password or other authentication methods such as Google and Facebook. Firebase Realtime Database was used to store user data and track their daily habits. The database can be accessed from anywhere, and data is synchronised in real-time, ensuring that users' data is always up-to-date. Using Firebase for authentication and database management allowed the "MakeU - A Habit Tracking Android Application" to provide a secure, reliable, and scalable user experience.

# Problem Statement

The problem addressed by the "MakeU - A Habit Tracking Android Application" is the difficulty many people face in developing and maintaining healthy habits. It can be challenging to incorporate new behaviours into our daily routine and to stay motivated to continue practising them over time. Furthermore, it can be challenging to keep track of our progress and to identify areas where we need to improve. The "MakeU - A Habit Tracking Android Application" aims to address these issues by providing a user-friendly tool that helps users set, track, and maintain healthy habits. The application allows users to customise their habits and receive reminders to help them stay on track. By helping users develop and maintain healthy habits, the "MakeU - A Habit Tracking Android Application" aims to improve users' overall health and wellness.
Primary Expected Outcome:
1. The user logs in or registers to become a part of the MakeU database.
2. The user adds a list of habits he/she wishes to accomplish throughout the day.
3. The user adds more habits or deletes already existing ones based on his/her requirements.
4. After completing a habit, the user goes on the application, marks the habit as done and moves on.
5. At the end of the day, the user can see how many of the habits he/she was able to accomplish throughout the day.
6. The user can then uncheck the checkboxes for a new day.
