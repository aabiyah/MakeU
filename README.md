MakeU - Habit Tracking Android Application

MakeU is an Android application that helps users establish and maintain new habits. The app allows users to create custom habits and track their progress over time, providing motivation and accountability to support their habit-forming efforts.

The app is built using Kotlin and follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It uses Firebase for user authentication and database storage, allowing users to securely store their habit data in the cloud.

Features:
1. Create custom habits with customizable name, description, and target goal
2. Track habit completion with a simple and intuitive interface
3. View progress over time with daily, weekly, and monthly habit completion graphs
4. Get reminders and notifications to stay on track with habit-forming efforts

Installation:
To install MakeU, download the APK file from the releases page and install it on your Android device. Alternatively, you can clone this repository and build the app using Android Studio.

Usage:
Once installed, simply open the app and create a new account or log in with an existing account. From there, you can create custom habits and start tracking your progress towards your habit-forming goals.

Future Scope:
1. Notifications: Allowing the user to get prompts for new habits and reminders for pre existing ones.
2. Deleting habits: Adding a swipe button to allow the user to delete the habit and adding a Toast saying “Habit Deleted”.
3. Weekly and monthly checklist: Currently, the application works on a daily checklist. Adding a weekly and monthly checklist would benefit the user.
4. Statistics: Weekly and monthly statistics to allow the user to track his/her progress and improve if needed.
5. Access to treatment: Adding an option to reach out to doctors or therapist for treating bad habits.
